     * `cash` is the number of tokens the Vault currently holds for the Pool. `managed` is the number of tokens
     * withdrawn and held outside the Vault by the Pool's token Asset Manager. The Pool's total balance for `token`
     * equals the sum of `cash` and `managed`.
     *
     * Internally, `cash` and `managed` are stored using 112 bits. No action can ever cause a Pool's token `cash`,
     * `managed` or `total` balance to be greater than 2^112 - 1.
     *
     * `lastChangeBlock` is the number of the block in which `token`'s total balance was last modified (via either a
     * join, exit, swap, or Asset Manager update). This value is useful to avoid so-called 'sandwich attacks', for
     * example when developing price oracles. A change of zero (e.g. caused by a swap with amount zero) is considered a
     * change for this purpose, and will update `lastChangeBlock`.
     *
     * `assetManager` is the Pool's token Asset Manager.
