## Requirements

Having installed [Foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is the minimum requirement to get started.

Run `make` to install dependencies.

## Tests

After installing dependencies with `make`, run `make test` to run the tests.

## Building and testing

```sh
git clone https://github.com/fiatdao/delphi
cd delphi
make # This installs the project's dependencies.
make test
```

## Deploying contracts

This is done typically in a different repo that imports this repo.
